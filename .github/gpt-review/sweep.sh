# nothing executed -- so the real runs sweep them: the review job
# ends with this, whatever became of the review, and the
# review-bots tooling can run it by hand.  Only skipped runs of
# this one workflow; failures, cancellations and successes are
# history and stay.

# 403 is a token short of actions: write, a 5xx is GitHub's hour,
# and calling either "already gone" left every skipped run behind
# with a green exit.  Any other status is reported and fails the
# sweep; a pass that deletes nothing stops the loop rather than
